<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

**Greetings from Evanston.** 

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Northwestern University under the supervision of [Prof. Ying Wu](http://users.ece.northwestern.edu/~yingwu/). I am interested in computer vision, multi-modality, embodied AI, and vision-language models. My current research areas are <ins>**multi-modality**</ins> and <ins>**embodied AI**</ins>, especially active visual recognition with vision-language understanding, which integrates intelligent control strategies into the visual recognition process to solve various recognition challenges.
I am constantly investigating the challenges inherent to active vision agents in an open-world context. These challenges include, but are not limited to, *multi-modality*, *vision-language models*, and *few-sample learning*.

In addition to embodied AI, I also have project experience in other real-world vision challenges, including temporal action localization, anomaly detection, and medical image analysis. 

My detailed resume/CV is [here](./files/JianxiongZhou_Resume_Sep_2024.pdf) (last updated on September 2024).

[Outlier-Probability-Based Feature Adaptation for Robust Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Contaminated Training Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10542974)

**Jianxiong Zhou**, Ying Wu

- Propose a robust unsupervised anomaly detection method OPFA that can mitigate the influence of contaminated training data and improve the detection of anomalous samples.
- OPFA improves features by contracting normal features and contrasting normal features with outlier features, allowing it to outperform other methods in contaminated data scenarios.

[Micro-expression spotting with a novel wavelet convolution magnification network in long videos](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865524000035)

**Jianxiong Zhou**, Ying Wu

- Our approach combines wavelet decomposition and a learnable motion magnification module to enhance the optical flow features of micro-expressions, making them easy to detect.
- We design a selective magnification attention module to suppress background disturbances and highlight MEs. The ablation study and visualization results show that it works as expected.

- The proposed TFE-DCN has an enlarged receptive field that covers a long temporal span to observe the full dynamics of action instances, making it powerful to capture temporal dependencies between snippets.
- The Modality Enhancement Module can enhance RGB features with enhanced optical flow features to make the overall features suitable for the WTAL task.
